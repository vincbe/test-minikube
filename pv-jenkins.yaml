# the directories created on the underlying hosts are only writable by root.
# You either need to run your process as root in a privileged container or modify the file permissions on the host to be able to write to a hostPath volume
# Not very acceptable .. if I don't want to go root and privileged, I need to find a way to apply this:
# On the host : (mannually : minikube ssh)
# $ sudo chmod +gW /data/pv-jenkins/
# $ sudo chown root:1000 /data/pv-jenkins/

# Other test with real host mounted to the minikube node (that is finnakly docker host)
